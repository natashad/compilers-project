Program B
---------
A1b contains 2 array declarations and 2 Array assignments. 
The first Array is a 1D array and the second a 2D.

The 1D array declaration uses a positive bound and the following form:
var arrayName [bound] : type
The 2D array declaration uses negative and positive bounds and the following form:
var arrayName [bound .. bound, bound .. bound] : type


Program E
---------
A1e contains 3 procedures and 3 functions and then calls them in an arbitrary order. 
For both procedures and functions there is one recursive with parameters, one recursive without parameters, 
and one which has a nested procedure/function declaration. 

The 3 procedures are as follows: prints from a global int down to 0, prints n^k (input n, k), 
and one which prints twenty added to an input n. 

The functions are as follows: prints from a global int down to 0, prints the nth fibonacci number (input n), 
and one which adds arbitrary numbers to input n.
