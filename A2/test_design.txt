%TODO:
Test for procedureHead as done in FailingFunctionHead tests.
Test for incorrect type: i.e. try using int instead of integer, or double or something that isn't defined.
More tests for associativity, success + failure: e.g. (not not a) should parsee, but (not not) a should not. Also things a>b>c should not, but a +b +c should.

Failing Tests:
--------------
A1d.488 - a program using non-recursive functions and procedures with and without parameters.
        - Fails because there are declarations but no statements in the scope.
A1e.488 - a program using recursive functions and procedures with and without parameters
        - including one nested procedure and one nested function declaration. Fails because of
        - Declarations defined after statements in scope.
FailingArgumentList.488 - Test using an incorect argument list. Arguments are given types.
FailingArrayTest.488 - Bad array declaration. Attempted 3D Declaration.
FailingArrayTest2.488 - Bad 2D array DECLARATION. Written in java format. i.e. array[a][b]
FailingArrayTest3.488 - Array Declared without a type.
FailingArrayTest4.488 - Attempt to declare an array using an expression to calculate bounds within declaration.
FailingArrayTest5.488 - Bad syntax for array with Left and Right bounds. Extra '.'
FailingArrayElementAsVariable.488 - Attempting to ACCESS a 2D array in a Java-esque way i.e. array[a][b]
FailingFunctionHead1.488 - Function declared without a return type.
FailingFunctionHead2.488 - Function parameters declared in java/c-esque way: e.g. functioname(int a)
FailingMultipleVariableDeclaration.488 - Multiple variables declared inline without being comma separated.
forwardStatementBeforeDeclaration.488 - Declarations after statements in scope.
Associativity.488 - Test for associativity a = b = c.
